# Project Overview

My goal for this project is to lift assembly-level programming into something I feel comfortable directly using as a primary language, and also a suitable medium for directly distributing software.

Rough approach:

- design language for specifying binaries in general
- libraries for CPU targets, executable formats, etc.
- syntactic sugars similar to conventional assembly

This document is both detailed overview and brainstorming.

## Desiderata

Regarding binary specification, relevant system-level goals include:

- reproducibility: easily share binary by sharing code
- extensibility: easy variants without invasive edits
- adaptability: outcome depends on a system definition
- modularity: share definitions, incremental computing

These goals entangle: System definition must also be reproducible, extensible, and modular. A system definition can provide modules to the binary specification for adaptability. Transitive dependencies must be reproducible. Incremental computing should share work (local verification, partial evaluation, etc.) across similar but non-identical system definitions.

Regarding the programmer experience:

- a simple and locally comprehensible semantics
- looks and feels like well-documented assembly code
- automated verification of assumptions and reasoning
- easily visualize assembly, interactive debug views
- easy live coding, continuous feedback during change 
- flexible metaprogramming with macros and DSLs

These present significant design challenges. I'll generally prioritize system-level features over experiential properties, but some difficult design decisions are required.

## Why Another Language?

Some existing languages align with some of my desiderata. For example, F\* or Vale support reasoning, and Unison supports reproducible modularity. But none attend the whole range, much less offer the programmer experience I want. Historically, assembly languages haven't received a lot of love from programming language designers.

## Overview of Semantics

I propose to build upon a pure, untyped lambda calculus with lazy evaluation. A few data types - lists, numbers, dicts - receive optimized representations and accelerated operations. We'll model monadic effects in terms of a [freer monad](https://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf), and object-oriented inheritance in terms of [open fixpoint](http://fare.tunes.org/files/cs/poof.pdf).

The toplevel namespace is modeled in an object-oriented style, supporting inheritance and override of definitions and treating module 'include' like a mixin. This provides a foundation for open extension of assemblies and configurations.

Although the lambda calculus is not typed, we can support gradual typing, testing, visualization, and other reasoning tasks. This will be expressed at the namespace layer via simple naming conventions. For example, an assembler may recognize 'foo\_type' as defining the type of 'foo', then attempt an ad hoc type check based on this. 

## Performance

Performance of lambda calculus is mediocre by default, and bignum arithmetic won't help. Performance can be significantly enhanced with a little guidance. Some relevant patterns:

* *Acceleration*: Substitute a definition with a built-in. Choose built-ins that enable flexible computation, e.g. an accelerated abstract machine that can be recompiled to run on a CPU or GPGPU.

* *Parallelism*: Trigger a lazy computation early and evaluate in a background worker thread. This pattern is called 'sparks' in Haskell. We can also obtain some parallelism from acceleration.

* *Caching*: Remember expensive computations to avoid rework. Persistent caching can support incremental compilation. A shared remote cache with PKI infrastructure can support direct downloads of binaries.

These performance features may be guided by annotations or built-ins functions.

## Data

The built-in data types are numbers, lists, dicts, atoms, and functions. All data is immutable, i.e. you cannot update a list or dict, but you can construct a new list or dict in terms of updating an existing one.

- Numbers are bignum integers and exact rationals. Rounding of numbers is left to users, but the underlying representation may optimize for floating-point style usage (e.g. base 2 or 10).
- Lists are the one-size-fits-all sequential structure. Lists may be concretely represented by finger-tree ropes under the hood. Binaries are modeled as lists of small integers (0..255) and heavily optimized.
- Dicts are key-value associative structures. Keys must be comparable with equality, i.e. excluding functions. Dictionaries do not directly support iteration over keys, though it isn't difficult to maintain lists of keys. Variants are encoded as singleton dictionaries.
- Atoms are abstract data with equality. Modules may introduce guaranteed-unique atoms, and we can construct atoms from any data with equality (excluding functions). The underlying representation of atoms is hashed or interned enabling fast equality and dict lookups. 
- Functions are expressed in the lambda calculus.

Reflection APIs can bypass abstractions, e.g. to iterate a dictionary or render a function. But reflection APIs are not available for computation of the assembly result. 

## Objects

Objects are most useful for extension in context of mutually recursive definitions. For example, a grammar can be modeled as an object where each 'rule' is a parser combinator, enabling override of specific rules. We'll model objects at the module layer to support extension of the namespace.

Pure functions can model stateless objects in terms of open recursion via latent fixpoint. A basic object model with mixin composition is `Dict -> Dict -> Dict` in roles `Base -> Self -> Instance`. Here, 'Base' is a parent class, initially empty, and 'Self' is a future fixpoint.

        mix child parent = λbase. λself.
           let base' = parent base self in
           child base' self
        fix f = -- lazy built-in fixpoint
            let x = f x in x        
        new obj = fix (obj Dict.empty) 

It's best to design a syntax for constructing objects that avoids observing 'base' or 'self' prior to instantiation. Otherwise, there's a good chance of datalock on 'fix'.

### Singleton Instantiation

For stateless objects, we don't need more than one object instance. Instead of presenting a `Dict -> Dict -> Dict` function, we can directly instantiate the dictionary while preserving the mixin under a special interface. In case we need it, we can implicitly add a field to contain the mixin function. 

### Multiple Inheritance

We can feasibly model multiple inheritance, where an object specification inherits from several others that may share ancestors. We can apply a linearization algorithm, ensuring each shared ancestor is mixed in only once and in a consistent order. 

Linearization requires an identifier to distinguish whether two specifications are the same. We could use a class name in this role, then assert the name is always used with the same meaning within a given inheritance graph. It should be feasible for users to 'dynamically' define objects and inheritance graphs.

### Explicit Override

To resist accidents, it's very useful to syntactically distinguish between introducing and overriding a name. We could aim for a lightweight syntax like '=' vs. ':=', or something more visible and obvious like '(override) name = ...', or just 'override' or '@override'. 

### Stateful Specification

Mixins can model state-like updates, treating Base as a previous state, Instance as next state, and Self as final state.

        λbase. λself. Base with { 
            v = base.next, 
            next = 1 + base.next 
        }

This can provide a foundation for allocating unique identifiers or building tables. However, this pattern easily interferes with lazy loading of modules if we aren't careful about integration. Ideally, a front-end compiler would provide dedicated syntax for safe patterns.

## Effects

Even without a runtime, effects are convenient for implicit dataflow, backtracking and error handling, flexible composition, extensible behavior, etc.. I'll use Haskell(-ish) syntax to describe these, but it should be easy to translate.

        type Eff rq a =
            | Yield (rq x) (x -> Eff rq a)
            | Return a

We can model a free-er effects monads as either *yielding* a request, continuation pair or *returning* a final result. In case of yield, the expected response type depends on the request. Of course, in context of untyped lambda calculus, enforcement may be limited.

We can easily introduce some syntactic sugar:

        (sugar)         (monadic ops)
        a <- op1        op1 >>= \ a ->
        op2             op2 >>= \ () ->
        op3 a           op3 a

We can specialize the monadic operators for our only monad. Our untyped lambda calculus doesn't offer a direct solution to type-indexed behavior, such as typeclasses, so this is convenient:

        (Yield rq k1) >>= k2 = Yield rq (k1 >=> k2)
        (Return a) >>= k = k a
        k1 >=> k2 = (>>= k2) . k1

Effectively, '>>=' captures the continuation into 'Yield'. Unfortunately, the Kleisli composition `>=>` is left-associative, i.e. `((((k1 >=> k2) >=> k3) >=> k4) >=> k5)`, but this rebuilds the entire 'stack' on every step. Right-associative `(k1 >=> (k2 >=> (k3 >=> (k4 >=> k5))))` performance is superior. Ideally, the assembler optimizes this, logically recognizing and rewriting `>=>`. We can also rewrite `(k >=> Return)` and `(Return >=> k)` to `k` as a form of tail-call optimization (TCO). We'll want TCO in general for long-running loops.

Behavior is embodied in the runner or handler. Almost any effect can be modeled, the primary exception being race conditions. Not all effects are fully 'compatible'. A few examples:

        -- a reader monad passes an implicit environment
        runEnv e (Yield Env k) = runEnv e (k e)
        runEnv e (Return r) = r

        -- a state monad supports update of a state var
        -- returns final value of state
        runState s (Yield Get k) = runState s (k s)
        runState _ (Yield (Put s) k) = runState s (k ())
        runState s (Return r) = (r,s)

        -- a list monad models lazy, ordered, non-deterministic choice
        runChoice (Yield (Choice xs) k) = List.flatMap (runChoice . k) xs
        runChoice (Return r) = List.singleton r

        -- delimited continuations
        runCont (Yield (Shift fn) k) = runCont (fn k)
        runCont (Yield (Reset op) k) = runCont op >>= runCont . k
        runCont (Return r) = r

It is feasible to compose effects via stack of 'monad transformers'. We can simply pass unrecognized effects up the stack, perhaps add some scoping rules.

        -- environment transformer with implicit Lift
        runEnvT e (Yield Env k) = runEnvT e (k e)
        runEnvT e (Yield rq k) = Yield rq (runEnvT e . k)
        runEnvT _ r@(Return _) = r

        -- state transformer with explicit Lift
        runStateT s (Yield Get k) = runStateT s (k s)
        runStateT _ (Yield (Put s) k) = runStateT s (k ())
        runStateT s (Yield rq k) = Yield rq (runStateT s . k)
        runStateT s (Return r) = Return (r,s)

        -- scope effects at boundary
        runScopeT (Yield (Outer rq) k) = Yield rq (runScopeT . k)
        runScopeT (Yield _ k) = error "unrecognized effect in scope"
        runScopeT r@(Return _) = r

Monad transformers can often be composed with a trivial runPure.

        runPure (Return r) = r
        runPure (Yield rq k) = error "unhandled effect in runPure"

        runEnv e = runPure . runEnvT e
        runState s = runPure . runStateT s

Unfortunately, monad transformers don't play nicely with higher-order effects. For example, a `runContT . runStateT s` would not include state in the higher-order `(Shift fn)` or `(Reset op)`. In practice, the best solution is to define a general-purpose *Monolithic Effects* handler, then support extension and composition of effects aligned with dimensions other than the 'call stack'.

*Note:* It is not difficult to model an IO monad with access to filesystem, network, etc.. We will support limited IO when scripting an IDE for interactive development. However, the assembler is not intended to be a general-purpose runtime, and I hope to minimize 'runtime' concerns for both safety and performance.

### Monadic Fixpoint

Haskell has *MonadFix* and a *RecursiveDo* syntactic sugar, enabling a result to be used before it is defined. In context of assembly, this would be convenient because it enables users to reference forward to labels for branches or jumps. We might encode this as `(Yield (Fix f) k)` where `f : a -> Eff rq a`. 

To evaluate a Fix request requires lazy handling of a future Return value, passing the main result back into 'f' and handling state correctly. Ultimately, 'Fix' must be passed up the handler stack and correctly handled at every step until closed by a 'runPure' or equivalent.

        runStateT s (Yield (Fix f) k) = Yield (Fix f') k' where
            f' = runStateT s . f . fst
            k' (r, s') = runStateT s' (k r)

        runPure (Yield (Fix f) k) = runPure (k (fix (runPure . f)))

Fixpoint is not compatible with all effects. But it may be feasible to restrict troublesome effects within scope of 'Fix'.

### Monolithic Effects

Instead of custom handlers per task, I propose to develop one general-purpose handler then rely on indexed state and continuations to build a library of extensible effects. We can include 'fixpoint' for lazy futures, and non-deterministic choice for search. A viable general-purpose handler:

        run s = runChoice . runContStateT [] s
        
        runContStateT cc s (Yield rq k) = match rq with
            Get -> runContStateT cc s (k s)
            (Set s') -> runContStateT cc s' (k ())
            (Shift ix fn) -> match cc with
                (ix',k'):cc' ->
                    -- pop a matched Reset frame, 'fn' may restore it
                    if (ix == ix') then runContStateT cc' s ((fn k) >>= k') else
                    -- otherwise, rebuild Reset stack in continuation
                    runContStateT cc' s (Yield rq (\r -> Yield (Reset ix' (k r)) k')) 
                [] -> error "unhandled shift in scope"
            (Reset ix op) -> runContStateT ((ix,k):cc) s op
            (Fix f) -> Yield (Fix f') k' where
                f' = runContStateT [] s . f . fst
                k' (r,s') = runContStateT cc s' (k r)
            _ -> Yield rq (runContStateT cc s . k)
        runContStateT ((_,k):cc) s (Return r) = runContStateT cc s (k r)
        runContStateT [] s (Return r) = Return (r,s)

        runChoice (Return r) = List.singleton r
        runChoice (Yield rq k) = List.flatMap (runChoice . k) <| match rq with
            (Choice xs) -> xs
            (Fix f) -> fixChoice (runChoice . f)

        fixChoice f = match (fix (f . head)) with
            [] -> []
            (x:_) -> x : fixChoice (tail . f)

Fixpoint and continuations are not fully compatible. We mitigate this by having Fix serve as an absolute boundary for Shift, i.e. you cannot Shift within Fix without a local Reset. Performance will suffer if we have too many Choices under Fix.

It is feasible to model cooperative threads with a shared heap, mutexes and semaphores, and other conventional imperative features in terms of delimited continuations for threads and 'context switching' a hierarchical volume of state for the current thread. But I wouldn't recommend it in general. In practice, it's much simpler to reason about outcomes of single-threaded assembly, and to parallelize subcomputations in terms of lazy sparks instead of threads.

### Effectful Pattern Matching

Desugaring pattern matching to a Choice effect is a good fit: 

- Final Return value is the match result.
- The empty choice becomes match failure.
- Branching corresponds to match cases.
- Defer branching to share work prefixes.

In most programming languages, pattern matching resists refactoring. By explicitly modeling pattern matching as a choice effect, it is not difficult to integrate both Haskell-like view patterns and refactoring of entire volumes of `Pattern -> Outcome` pairs. Further, this provides an opportunity to integrate other effects, e.g. parser combinators are patterns that manage implicit state, or we could use effectful patterns with backtracking failure for conditionals or while loops, or effectively support while-case loops.

Purely functional pattern matching, like Haskell's 'match', can be implemented generically in terms of runChoice. Effectful choice requires more specialized integration, e.g. to capture and revert state. This can be mitigated by introducing an 'effect' for committed first choice, pushing integration of decision making to the handler. In practice, we should have clearly distinct syntax for effectful vs. pure pattern matching. Perhaps 'if try PatternOp then ...' or similar. 

We should distinguish external non-deterministic choice from local pattern-matching first-choice. They represent different intentions and connotations. To keep it simple, I propose replacing 'Choice' with 'Try' to indicate local patterns.

## Modules

A module is represented by a file, and represents a mixin object. The assembler provides a built-in front-end compiler for ".g" files, but *User-Defined Syntax* is supported, with users defining a monadic front-end compilers aligned to file extensions, and the assembler bootstrapping upon override.

To simplify architecture, file dependencies are constrained: a file may reference only local files within the same folder or subfolders (no parent-relative ("../") or absolute paths), or content-addressed remote files (by DVCS revision hash and filename). File dependencies must form a directed acyclic graph. Files and subfolders whose names start with "." are also hidden from the module system.

A module is integrated by 'including' it as a mixin. Any prior definitions or inclusions effectively model prior mixins. We can translate inclusion to a dictionary defined within the host environment. Thus, we could have a few import forms:

* *include Module* - bind included module's Base to host's current Base namespace, sharing Self.
* *include Module at m* - apply module to override component dictionary 'm', i.e. binds Base->Base.m, Self->Self.m, 
* *import Module as m* - introduces 'm' with `{ "env": Self.env }` (by default), then applies 'include Module at m'.
  - This treats 'env' as an implicit, read-only environment at the module layer, supporting adaptability. Extensions to 'env' apply only to hierarchical imports.

The hierarchical 'include at' and 'import as' forms simplify lazy loading. In contrast, with toplevel 'include', it is often difficult to determine which modules introduce or override a definition without loading everything. Ultimately, there is only one 'Self'. This simplifies deep overrides and extensions, analogous to mutable definitions without actual mutation.

### Configuration

The assembler implicitly loads a configuration module based on the `GLAM_CONF` environment variable or an OS-specific default, i.e. `"~/.config/glam/conf.g"` in Linux or `"%AppData%\glam\conf.g"` in Windows. A small, local user configuration typically extends a large, remote community or company configuration.

The configuration serves several roles:

- *Assembly environment*: define 'env' as the Base argument for assembly modules. This environment can provide default target information, system includes and shared libraries, etc. for adaptation.
- *Command-line macros*: define a rewrite for command-line arguments. Applied if (and only if) the first command-line argument does not start with '-'. Supports extensible CLI 'language'.
- *Development environment*: Define the loop for interactive mode. Define an adapter for reflection tasks. Filter and rewrite log messages for standard error in batch mode. Other user-experience tuning. 
- *Resource management*: may specify GPGPUs available for acceleration, cache locations and replacement heuristcs, history management, shared proxy compilation and cache, alternative search locations for content-addressed remotes, tune assembler JIT or GC heuristics, quotas for testing, etc..

For flexibility, `GLAM_CONF` may list multiple files (same OS-specific separator as the `PATH` variable). These files are applied as mixins, i.e. files earlier in the list override those later, left to right. If there is need, we could further extend this to 'inline' or 'remote' files via special URLs. A motivating use cases for listing multiple files are to separate resource management, project-specific, and user-specific tuning.

Other environment variables do not directly influence configuration, but may be accessible in context of reflection and may influence assembler behavior (e.g. tuning JIT or GC). For portability reasons, the user configuration should have an opportunity to reflect and intervene on any features configured through environment variables.

### Assembly

The assembler receives command-line arguments that express an assembly module as a list of mixins. Though, in practice, it's usually just one file or script. Relevant arguments:

- `(-f|--file) FileName` - list a file to include; first file is included last, overriding those listed later. Depending on the configured environment, assembly isn't limited to ".g" files (see *User-Defined Syntax*).
- `(-s|--script).FileExt Text` - as remote file with given extension and text. Scripts cannot import local files, hence are location-independent. 
- `-- List Of Args` - assembler defines 'args' before including files or scripts. Default is empty list, but caller may override with elements following the '--' separator.

The namespace for an assembly starts with 'args' and 'env' from command line and configuration respectively. An assembly module shall define 'result', representing the assembled product, i.e. a binary or folder.

### Remotes

Remote files are content-addressed, typically at DVCS scope. This might be expressed as a dict or object with:

- DVCS protocol (git, hg, darcs)
- DVCS repo revision hash
- filename within repo
- list of repo URLs (backups!)
- tag or branch name(s)

The file is uniquely identified and authenticated by revision hash and filename. The repo URLs support multiple backup search locations; this list may be rewritten by the user configuration. A tag or branch name is used only as a hint for efficient download, such as: `git clone -b Branch --single-branch URL`.

Remote files are a little awkward for syntax and maintenance. We'll need a good multi-line syntax for remote imports, and the ability to use expressions or abstract remotes into a separate index file. Perhaps we model each import as a miniature object? 

*Aside:* We aren't restricted to DVCS. Viable alternatives include download of secure-hashed zipfiles, or even individual source files. But my intuition is that DVCS will offer the best development and maintenance experience for content-addressed structure.

### Access Control

There is no 'export' control on modules. Everything defined in a module is exported, accessible for override. This simplifies extension, but increases risk of accidental name conflicts. The latter is mitigated by explicit overrides and hierarchical import structures. We do control the Base argument to a hierarchical module, i.e. 'env.\*', which can be leveraged with some idioms and patterns. For example, a module that defines a library may emit 'api.\*' as the primary public interface. We may then restrict 'env.\*' to share the public interface. 

        import "foo.g" as libfoo
        env.foo = libfoo.api
        override libfoo.*
        libfoo.settings.x = 42

In theory, we could use *Stateful Specification* or a secure hash to allocate anonymous namespaces, but doing so complicates things for users more than I'd prefer.

## Assembler

Primary behavior and inputs are detailed in *Modularity*. Roughly:

- load a configuration (`GLAM_CONF`) 
- construct an assembly (`-f -s --`)
- evaluate then extract the 'result'

By default, we expect a binary result and extract to standard output. However, the assembler supports a few other filesystem-aligned options for extraction:

- *Expectation:* data type of result
  - `--binary` (default) - result is binary 
    - list of integers in 0..255
  - `--folder` - result models folder as dict 
    - dict keys are file and folder names
    - dict values are binaries or folders
- *Extraction:* where to put result
  - `--stdout` (default) - write binary to standard output
    - incompatible with folders and interactive development
  - `(-o|--out) Destination` - output to named file or folder
  - `--discard` - no output, result is ignored

Machine-code mnemonics are left to libraries. Assuming accelerators and user-defined syntax, we can adapt this 'binary' assembler to many targets: ray tracing, typesetting, websites, simulations, blueprints, etc..

### Interaction

Instead of repeatedly asking an assembler to evaluate a result, we can ask an assembler to repeatedly evaluate a result, i.e. external versus internal loops. The internal loop enables some optimizations, e.g. for incremental computing. But the main benefit is that the assembler process sticks around and is available for interrogation. Some useful possibilities: language server protocol, REPL, graphical debug views, progressive disclosure, editable projections, integrated development, etc..

The assembler shall support interactive mode via simple command-line switch:

- `--batch` (default) - evaluate and extract result once, return
- `(-i|--interactive)` - maintain result, configurable interface
  - discards result by default, but compatible with `-o`

To avoid cluttering command-line arguments, and to keep the executable small, the assembler asks the user configuration to define an interaction loop. The loop may observe environment variables, assembler capabilities, and assembly definitions. Thus, with a few conventions, we can specialize the loop to an assembly or task.

Interaction limits effects:

- *Filesystem:* Limited to files that contribute to assembly or configuration, plus associated files under ".glam/". Respects read-only restrictions. Remote files and scripts are always treated as read-only.
- *Network:* Cannot initiate connections. Listens on configured TCP ports or Unix Domain Sockets. May introduce specialized operations to synchronize local filesystem sources with DVCS repos.
- *TTY*: A standard input and output stream, modeled as an implicit network connection. Standard error is disabled.
- *Env*: access to OS environment, runtime version info, and similar features.
- *GUI*: tentative support for native GUI. Even without this, we can support GUI via Network or TTY.

The interaction loop may be expressed as a transactional 'step' method. This step runs repeatedly, subject to transaction-loop optimizations: optimistic concurrency on choice, incremental computing, await relevant update after abort. Updates to the user configuration may influence future steps. Effects are abstracted: effectful operations use constructors linked via object Base. 

### Debugging

When developing a library, it is often convenient to test entire volumes of definitions instead of just 'result' and its transitive dependencies. I propose `--test Name` that may be listed more than once. We can name entire dictionaries of definitions, such as `--test env` or `--test api`, for bulk testing. Testing includes best-effort typechecking and transitive dependencies. We'll often `--discard` the result during testing, perhaps adding `--test result`.

Tests may use non-deterministic choice to support fuzzing, property checking, and flexible analysis. In batch mode, we'll rely on configurable quotas and heuristics to determine whether we've done 'enough' testing. In interactive mode, tests may run indefinitely or based on user attention. These `--test` flags then determine an initial set of tests and user focus.

In batch mode, visualizations are filtered and rendered by a configurable method, then written to standard error. In interactive mode, we can potentially support interactive visualizations with progressive disclosure, dynamic views and queries, etc.. 

With effective acceleration, tests may emulate hardware for assembly targets. But external testing of an assembly doesn't easily feedback into debugging. It may be possible to trace a coredump to the associated sources. Perhaps we can extract a 'folder' that includes  generated together with the executable. See *Reasoning* for some patterns for debugging.

### Live Programming

Another process may continuously "run" an assembly result, watching for changes and integrating them. In context of executable machine code, this requires non-trivial setup, or at least restrictions on the function expressed by the machine code.

Although the assembler does not implement live programming directly, it should at least ensure atomic updates. That is, instead of replacing files, it first writes a temporary file then uses 'rename' in Linux or 'ReplaceFile' in Windows. Readers in Windows should open the file in FILE_SHARE_DELETE mode to avoid blocking the writer.

The interactive mode assembler may also provide 'result' via HTTP requests, perhaps with an ETAG based on contributing sources.

### History

Deterministic functions, location-independent folders, and content-addressed remote modules all contribute to reproducibility. But we still cannot reproduce the output if we cannot reproduce the initial conditions. To improve practical reproducibility, the assembler should automatically maintain a sufficient history to reproduce prior assemblies, ideally with structure sharing and effective pruning. 

In practice, this may require copying local files and maintaining a local DVCS repo to represent the history. Though, we'll also need a little attention on merging history for concurrent assembler processes. (I wonder if darcs would be a good fit here.)

## User-Defined Syntax

When loading a module, a front-end compiler is selected from the provided environment based on file extension, i.e. `Base.env.lang.[FileExt]` should evaluate to an object or dict that defines 'compile'. This object may also define auxilliary methods for tooling or the interaction loop, e.g. syntax highlighting or a specialized language-server protocol. To normalize FileExt, we lower-case 'A-Z' and strip initial '.'. In case of ".g" files, the assembler provides a built-in as a fallback, but we favor a user-defined compiler.

The 'compile' method is expressed effectfully, as a parser combinator. The effects are carefully designed to simplify tracing of errors back to sources, isolate parse errors, support edit suggestions.

- Parser combinators are a great starting point. Parser combinators can implicitly track parse locations and describe what they 'expect' to see at any given step, providing effective feedback in case of syntax errors and metadata for tracing.
- To simplify tracing, blame, error isolation, etc. the compiler must avoid directly observing parse results. Even parse errors must be abstracted. To enforce this, we return abstract data from parse operations by default, perhaps expressed via applicative functor. We must provide built-in combinators for optionals and loops.
- In context of error isolation, we cannot model monadic 'state' at compile time in general, but we could support a few special cases where state is easily 'forked' for parsing subcomponents, especially gensym: abstract, unique, unforgeable symbol generation.
- We can feasibly support something like a 'writer' monad for tests, illustrations, editable projections, indexes, etc.. However, if we hope to preserve lazy loading, we must be careful about automatic composition of indices. Use of annotations may mitigate this.
- To support syntax-driven effects without observing the syntax, we can introduce an eval effect that lifts a user expression into the front-end compiler. The result of eval is then abstracted. This effectively supports some forms of macros.
- It is useful to support multi-pass parses. For example, a first pass might delimit the 'region' for another pass. Even if we drop the first pass result, this can be useful for error isolation.
- Compiler keeps module dictionaries (Base, Self) abstract, user only accesses them indirectly. This simplifies monadic tracking of dependencies.

Expressing a compiler without being able to 'see' the binary seems possible in theory, but I'm not entirely convinced that we won't reintroduce the tracing problem via Eval. To gain confidence, I must try it first with the standard syntax. After all, we should be able to override and extend the standard syntax, too. Worst case, I'm back to the conventional approach.

### Syntactic Bootstraps

If the final `Self.env.lang.[FileExt].compile` method is different from the Base version, the assembler attempts bootstrap. This involves recompiling with the Self version, repeating until fixpoint is reached.

        bootstrap(ext, base, binary, compiler) =
            let m = compile(compiler, base, binary) 
            let compiler' = 
                m.env.lang.[ext].compile if defined
                or builtin if ext is "g"
            if(compiler == compiler') then m else
            bootstrap(ext, args, compiler')

A built-in compiler is simply treated as one more compiler in the bootstrap cycle, equivalent only to itself. 

### Editable Projections

Some user-defined syntax may be graphical. And even for purely textual syntax, we'll often want to integrate some visualizations or provide edit widgets like color pickers. Miscellaneous observations:

- We can only edit terms annotated with source locations, parser context, and an encoder that converts the parse result back into source (aka lenses or prisms). We can verify any edits for round-trip between parse and encode.
- Some content is naturally read-only, e.g. content-addressed remote files, read-only local files. In these cases, we can still support navigation, views, etc.. and partially-editable views are feasible.
- Support for navigation, progressive disclosure, etc. benefits from user-local or session state. 
- It is convenient to treat a file that does not exist as equivalent to an empty file for purpose of imports and projections.
- Ideally, we can obtain immediate feedback on edits by visualization of tests. This may require some integration of projections and tests.

TBD: This is non-trivial, and I don't have a solid handle on exactly how to approach it.

### Language Versioning

We may update front-end compilers with new features. When these updates are not backwards compatible, we may need to switch to an older version of the compiler for processing specific files. But this is awkward for the root ".g" language. For that case, we may benefit from an explicit language version selector near the top of each file, perhaps expressed as a pragma.

In practice, we can always override the front-end compiler for remote files, and we can always edit local files. So, we probably don't need the pragma. But it seems like a convention that contributes to more-robust systems development.

## Reasoning

What can we feasibly implement to support developers in reasoning about the assembly process and product?

* *Types*: We can describe assumptions about programs and data in a composable, machine-checkable way. This is directly useful for discovering and resisting bugs in the assembly metaprogramming. It's more difficult to specify anything meaningful about the assembly output, i.e. the generated program, though clever use of dependent types, phantom types, GADTs may help.

* *Tests*: We can sample subprogram behavior under various conditions. We can simulate or emulate execution of machine code. With acceleration, emulation may even perform adequately. With non-deterministic choice, it is feasible to fuzz test indefinitely, simulate race conditions, check a wide variety of conditions. Heuristic non-deterministic choice together with abstract interpretation can effectively lift tests into constraint models.

* *Contracts*: We can describe a monadic subprogram's stateful preconditions, postconditions, invariant assumptions. It is feasible to check these conditions, either directly (via handler) or indirectly, by integration with a type system. This isn't especially useful for verifying correct output, but it's a simple and direct approach to verifying programmer assumptions and isolating errors.

* *Proofs*: Under Curry-Howard, types can be understood as theorems, and programs as proofs. But for sophisticated types, verifying types may involve expensive searches. Ideally, we can provide some hints to reduce the verification overheads, separate from the program itself but perhaps as part of a declaration.

* *Visualization*: We can support developers in viewing the assembly process, obtaining useful feedback. This includes text logs, interactive debuggers, and graphical outputs including tests and simulations. User-defined visualizations should be possible both within an assembly and generically via user configuration of interaction mode. Bonus points if visualization integrates smoothly with editable projections of source.

* *Tracing*: An assembler can maintain some metadata to trace outputs back to sources. However, there's a rather severe tradeoff between precision and performance. This can be mitigated by replay with greater precision or with an intersection of different mappings. Ideally, developers may also guide tracing via annotations.

* *Profiling*: Feedback about where an assembler is spending its time is useful for identifying infinite loops and improving performance of the assembly process. It won't help much with output modulo profiling of emulations.

* *Abstract Interpretation*: We can interpret machine code against an abstract representation of machine state. With reflection, we can do similarly for lambdas. We can include assumptions and test for contradiction or consistency. It is feasible to integrate a constraint model to perform the actual checks.

### Reflection

The logic required for reasoning, e.g. a type-checker with effective caching, is non-trivial. I would prefer to not represent or maintain this logic within the assembler executable. A viable alternative is to represent this logic within the module system, providing a reflection API for adequate access to assembler internals. The assembly and user configuration may define a set of reflection tasks.

Reflection shall be expressed effectfully, the assembler executable implementing a monadic API. This supports local context per reflection task and awaiting events. The reflection API may be unstable, version-specific, albeit subject to de facto standardization and providing standard means to query assembler version info. A user configuration may further define a task adapter for portability.

Constraints for a 'good' reflection API: In context of incremental compilation, the API should be cacheable. In context of interactive programming and debugging of reasoning, the API should be regenerable (restartable, replayable). In context of large systems, the API should be safe to run concurrently. I propose to rely on CALM principles - consistency as logical monotonicity - to ensure reasonable stability.

### Integration

In context of breaking changes under overrides, we should also repair reasoning via overrides. Thus, reflection tasks should align with the namespace. It is not difficult to annotate a namespace. For example, we could recognize `type.name = TypeDesc` as representing the type of 'name'. To keep it simple, an assembler recognizes only reflection tasks, but reflection tasks may recognize user-defined conventions.

In context of lazy loading, we need lazy reflection, i.e. reflection must be triggered by actual use of definitions. I propose to separate trigger and task as `refl.name = Trigger` and `name = Task`. By defining 'refl.name', we annotate associated 'name', effectively declaring it to represent a reflection task. The separation also aligns nicely with hierarchical namespaces. Proposed initial triggers:

- `Once (List of Name)` - trigger once if at least one name in the list is used. If the list is empty, trigger once when the module is loaded. Suitable for context-free tests, type checking, static assertions, etc..
- `Used Name` - trigger where a name is used. Provides access to context of use, e.g. continuations and function arguments. Effective for expressing dynamic assertions or contracts, visualizing actual usage, profiling.
- `Hierarchical` - expect 'name' to be a dictionary. Look for 'refl.\*' within that namespace when used. For hierarchical namespaces and object specifications.

Triggers bind names, not underlying definitions or thunks. Thus, users may further control reflection via aliasing.

### Constraints

Constraint systems are a convenient mechanism for abstract interpretation. 

We can feasibly accelerate sat/unsat judgements for constraint systems via cvc5, Z3, or other solvers. The DSL for constraints can be adapted from SMTLIB2. For variables, we might use `(Var x)`, where 'x' is any valid dictionary key, enabling users to develop their own naming schemas.

But an accelerator cannot observe the discovered solution or unsatisfiable kernel. Those are effectively non-deterministic. Only the sat/unsat judgement is observable. A reflection API is less limited, capable of returning the discovered solution and other details, and even reporting which solver was used and how long it took.

I envision building a constraint system statefully as part of building an assembled program. This could then be checked through reflection, or via acceleration depending on whether the judgement influences output or just pass/fail. 

### Non-deterministic Choice

We can easily provide APIs for the assembler to choose an integer (discrete) or rational (continuous). With attention to how these results are used in a test, this can provide a basis for heuristic search and fuzz testing. However, it is difficult to decide how much effort to spend exploring different branches, e.g. do we evaluate only once in batch mode? Up to a quota?

In any case, it won't hurt much to add non-deterministic choice. Users can still write deterministic tests if they want..

### Visualization

In context of interactive mode, every 'update' to the program will reset relevant reflection tasks. In context of rich structures, we'll inevitably want some 'view' state for progressive disclosure. It's important to maintain a relatively stable visualization and view state across updates, hence view state must be separate from reflection tasks, yet indexed in a stable manner.

In interactive mode, the configured interaction loop controls which elements are rendered. It may receive some means to query and filter views, to duplicate them, to manage view states, etc.. In batch mode, the configuration may provide a simplified mechanism to filter and render visualizations for standard error. Ideally, logging is still relatively stable to simplify comparisons of logs.

If a reflection API emits multiple visualizations, it may be convenient to support integration between them, i.e. adjusting a slider impacts multiple views in scope instead of just one view. This suggests something like a global 'view' state, albeit optionally allocating a local view identifier. Ideally, the user may view state, bookmark it, reset it, etc..

*Note:* Although reflection APIs should not directly be editing sources, a user-interactive visualization model may provide the additional capabilities to perform edits, bridging projectional editing.

## Assembly Monad

It is convenient to express assembly effectfully. Relevantly, monadic expression enables us to implicitly thread extensible context as we write machine-code mnemonics or binary outputs. An extensible context is useful for both reasoning, e.g. representing abstract machine states and developer assumptions, and code generation, e.g. allocation of registers. It also simplifies composition and staging. 

The assembler never sees this monad. It must already be handled in evaluation of 'result'. But most assembly code may be written effectfully, simply assuming a suitable handler.

Some features the assembly monad and the threaded context could tackle:

- allocation of static memory (bss, data, rodata, text)
- content-addressing of read-only memory (rodata, text)
- abstract interpretations of machine 'state', e.g. types, registers in use
- allocation of registers
- logically tracking data stack frames, offsets, avoiding unnecessary updates
- heap or arena allocations, tracking logical heap and allocation 'effects'
- OS integration, e.g. tracking signaling 'effects'

This monad is user-defined, thus we have freedom to extend it and explore alternatives. However, it isn't necessarily easy to adapt existing assembly libraries to leverage these extensions. Thus, it's best to achieve some de facto standardization early. 

## Standard Syntax

This section proposes the initial syntax for ".g" files. We'll be limited to minor changes, so I'll take some effort to make it good.

### Names and Namespaces

Basic names use the standard alphanumeric encodings, i.e. `[a-zA-Z0-9_]*`, excepting keywords. Namespaces are modeled as dictionaries. In this context, names are indexed as strings, i.e. `foo.bar == foo.["bar"]`. 


 i.e. we can substitute an older version of a front-end compiler when parsing older code. We can also borrow C's convention, reserving the form `__name` for compiler-provided built-ins.


The language may include some keywords, e.g. 'import' and 'include', that are not defined by the user. Language extensibility is a concern: there may be a conflict with old code when we introduce new keywords. This is mitigated by user-defined syntax, i.e. the client of a module may manage syntax used to interpret a module. It may be further mitigated by 'pragma language' declarations.

We may provide access to keywords like 'scope' for a dictionary representing names in scope, or 'prior' for a dictionary representing the base module namespace and perhaps 'module' referencing the module-level 'self'. The 'scope' may include keyword definitions like 'module' and 'prior'.

### Comments

We'll use `#` for conventional line comments. Everything from `#` to end of line (LF, CR, CRLF) is treated as part of the comment. There is no separate syntax for multi-line comments, so bring an editor that supports commenting multiple lines at once.

### Language Version 

        ('lang'|'language') ('g0'|Alt) ('with' FeatureFlagsAndExtensions)?

The first non-comment line in the ".g" file should be a language version declaration. This provides an opportunity to develop the syntax, e.g. introducing new keywords, while sharing the ".g" file extension and front-end compiler and ensuring stable outcomes. A front-end compiler does not need to recognize all language versions, but it should raise an error rather than attempt to parse a version it does not recognize.


### Lambdas

Haskell-style `\ x y z -> Expr` is adequate, though not pretty. We could treat definitions as a special syntactic case, e.g. `name x y z = ...` rewrites to `name = \ x y z -> ...`. 

We can support Haskell-style `let x = Expr1 and y = Expr2 in Expr` or `Expr where x = Expr1 and y = Expr2` syntactic forms that desugar to applied lambdas. Monadic desugaring may also need some attention.

### Definitions

I'd prefer to avoid bulky prefixes for introducing names, such as 'define name = '. Just directly support 'name =' or 'name x y z =' for an implicit lambda. We may have special forms for specifications and other structures, e.g. `class foo(bar, baz):`.

Overrides must be declared, e.g. `overrides foo, bar, baz` as a declaration.

No true 'private' definitions at module scope, but we can use '`_name`' as a simple convention, Python style. Defining 'api.\*' is better for distinguishing a library's public API, intended for the shared environment.

### (Tentative) Built-in Definitions

We'll need a few functions to work conveniently with lists, dictionaries, etc.. Most of these might use keywords or operators. But, if necessary, we may support compiler built-in definitions. Viable approaches: 

- reserve `__name` for compiler-provided definitions
- import of compiler built-in 'modules'

I think it's probably best to support both opportunities, which merely requires reserving names that start with `__`. But I'd prefer to focus on the operators and keywords route.

### Operators

To keep it simple, operators are all defined by the front-end compiler. That is, there is no operator override except via user-defined syntax. In context of bootstrapping, it's important to ensure any user-defined operators aren't in the bootstrap path.

### Symbol Generation



### Object Specifications

We could use a 'class' or 'spec' keyword. I do favor 'spec' for better connotations, but 'class' would be more familiar. 

The names 'self' and 'base' can be implicit parameters to the class or specification, such that 'self.foo' refers to the final definition of 'foo'. Names not accessed through 'self' or 'base' refer to the module layer. We can also provide access to 'class' or 'spec' as an interface.

We may need special syntax to override specification definitions, unless I can still use '=' vs. ':=' in this role. 

### Embedded Texts

Proposed syntax:

        "inline text"

        """
        " multi-line texts may include "quotes"
        " start of each line is "SP
          " vertical alignment recommended
        " each line terminated by LF
        "   even if host file uses CR or CRLF
        """

There are no escape characters and there is no built-in formatting. Instead, users must explicitly postprocess texts, perhaps passing 'scope' to access names. This keeps it simple and flexible at the cost of being slightly more verbose.

### Namespace Capture

For metaprogramming-like tasks, such as formatting strings, it's convenient to capture the current namespace as a first-class value. I propose 'scope' as a simple keyword for this role, returning a dictionary. In context of shadowing, this dictionary would contain only the final, shadowed form of a name.

A relevant design challenge is how 'scope' should interact with syntactic sugar for monadic fixpoint. Efficient fixpoint requires minimizing scope of fixpoint. Perhaps we mitigate this by requiring explicit forward declarations for monadic fixpoint (e.g. 'future names' or 'declare names') instead of implicit fixpoints.

### Embedded Numbers

All numbers are modeled as exact rationals, no hidden size or precision limits.

        0
        1
        -42
        1/7
        1.234
        1.23e-7

It is also convenient to support binary (0b) or hexadecimal (0x) natural numbers. 

        0x1234fedc
        0b10010001101001111111011011100

Divide by zero diverges lazily, reporting an error when forced or observed. Modeling complex numbers, vectors, matrices, etc. is left to developers. Integers and base

*Note:* Exact rational numbers are not suitable for high-performance number crunching. This may be mitigated by optimizing for e.g. rationals of form `M * 2^K` (for integers M and K), using a representation analogous to floating point under the hood. But if we need good performance, we'll need acceleration to leverage SIMD or GPGPU and fixed-width numeric encodings.

### Pattern Matching

I'd like to support flexible pattern matching, including user-defined constructors and other patterns.



### User-Defined Types

I would like to support lightweight declarations of type constructors and matching patterns.








### Numbers and Arithmetic

We'll support conventional numeric representations, including scientific notations, hexadecimal, and binary. We'll also support exact rational numbers via '/'.

        1.234
        1.234e-6
        2/3
        0b10111
        0xFEDCBA9876543210

We may accelerate conversions to and from binaries, and we'll support basic arithmetic (e.g. +-*/). Division by 0 is a lazy error, halting the assembler when observed.

*Note:* There is no notion of word size or endianness for assembler-level arithmetic.

### Pattern Matching

### Rejecting Operator Overloading






### Embedded Texts and Binaries

I don't like escape characters in programs. Instead, we can embed some texts then explicitly postprocess them



### Pointers (Tentative)

We could support 'pointers' via desugaring 

### Hierarchical Names

We can support 'deep' edits to names in hierarchical dictionaries.

        foo.bar.baz = BodyExpr

It might be convenient to support something like namespaces.

        @foo.bar
        baz = BodyExpr

        [foo.bar]
        baz = BodyExpr

This does require some way to reference 'root' names. I'll also want to reference names from within objects, which should be consistent. This suggests that the rules against shadowing would apply hierarchically.

### Numbers and Arithmetic

### Introduce vs. Override



### Design Constraints and Considerations

- No shadowing. Names used within a file and scope have only one meaning.
  - Keywords may be used as names, but cannot also be used as keywords in the same file.
  - Names via 'include' are initially invisible. As are methods inherited by an object.
    - We could explicitly declare such names in scope before use to make them 'visible'.
    - Visibility may be via 'using'.
    - May support aliasing in front-end compiler, e.g. 'using x as y', to avoid conflicts.
  - Users must distinguish introduction vs. override of words. 
    - no more than one override per file or object, to preserve consistent meaning.
- No user-defined operators, modulo updating user-defined syntax.
  - In part because user-defined operators don't align nicely with imports.
  - In part because operator overloading is easily confusing to users.
- Ideally, pattern matching is extensible and composable.
  - Consider model matching monadically? I.e. match then 'Return' a result or another monadic operation. 
  - 
- No escape characters. I really hate how those explode. Use explicit postprocessing instead.
- Tests, types, visualizations, etc. are bound to names.



### Data Embeddings

Some design constraints and desiderata:

- names have one meaning in visible scope
  - i.e. no shadowing of visible toplevel names
  - may shadow an unused toplevel name or keyword
  - rule allows for extensible set of keywords
  - may need to explicitly bring included names into scope
- distinguish intro vs. override 
  - modules, objects, standard effects
  - perhaps also dictionary updates
- operators have one meaning, globally
  - no user-defined operators modulo user-defined front-end compilers
  - ad hoc polymorphism across types only if meaning is consistent
  - dotted paths need some attention here, objects vs. dicts? all dicts?
- operators for flexible function compositions
  - pipes in either direction `|>` or `<|`
  - monad composition operator `>>=`
- no escape characters, e.g. no '\22' or '\"' characters in strings
  - well, '\22' could be used, but is just 3 chars until processed
  - user-defined postprocessing of texts instead, convenient syntax
- convenient multi-line and programmed texts
  - perhaps via stream writer monad, or writing a stateful buffer
  - target buffer could be indirect, abstracted via environment 
  - should be easy to compose writers procedurally, hierarchically
- clear 'sections' for error isolation
  - can separate sections without parsing content
  - e.g. based on indentation
- can capture module namespace (self or base) as a dictionary
- few basic arithmetic operators.
- limited dependency on precedence for operators.

- optimize syntax for naming things instead of arithmetic
- effective dotted path and indexed update notations
- dictionary composition (`d1 with d2`?)
- monadic syntactic sugar, explicit 'do'
  - RecursiveDo by default
  - distinguish = and <-
  - 
- specialized monad for writing lists, multi-line texts? Tentative. 

- vertical structure, avoids 'deep' indentation
- clear sections, i.e. for error isolation or REPL-like output
- no visible shadowing, names have clear meaning across scopes
  - may shadow names that aren't visible/mentioned in outer scope
  - may require explicit 'expect/extern' to bring names into scope
- clear distinction for introduce vs. override of names
  - may enforce this in the underlying syntax 
- machine-code mnemonic sequences *looks and feels* like assembly
- lightweight, composable syntax for multi-line and computed text
  - possibly a monadic syntactic sugar? or extension thereof?
- user-defined types and object interfaces
  - possible type-indexed behavior bound to named types?
- objects may use explicit 'self' and 'base'?
